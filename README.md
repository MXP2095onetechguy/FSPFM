# FSPFM

This [project](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff) inspired me to write this crappy file manager.

FSPFM is written in bash and has small amount of dependencies. FSPFM stands for Fuckingly-Simple-Portable-FileManager. It is so simple that you use CLI and UI hybrid instead of TUI. Very portable where it can be placed on other os.



What can you do:

Browse, view, run shell, yeah, that's it for now


You can install this thing with the install.sh file, while you can uninstall it with the uninstall.sh, nice?
